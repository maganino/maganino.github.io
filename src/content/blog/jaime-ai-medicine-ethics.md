## j'AI ME ❤️

I love doing this: vulgarising AI and sharing knowledge with everyone.

This week, I challenged myself again. I delivered an AI crash course for healthcare professionals, a completely new, multidisciplinary audience for me. And all that in French, not my daily technical language!

## The Invitation

A heartfelt thank you to Prof. Grégoire Wieërs for the invitation as guest speaker at the plenary meeting of the Ethics Committee of Clinique Saint Pierre (CSPO). What an honour to meet and exchange with such an inspiring medical community, and to spark a dialogue on the ethics of AI in healthcare.

## When a Presentation Becomes a Dialogue

The presentation quickly became a real dialogue, where I discovered how AI translates into questions, concerns, and dreams in the minds of healthcare professionals.

Many thanked me for "illuminating the AI grey zones." But honestly, I'm the one who should thank them. I came home with even more questions, new ideas, and a deeper sense of purpose.

## Why It Matters

AI entered our lives almost without asking permission, and everyone deserves the right to understand it, to make informed choices.

I'm simply happy to help make that happen. 🌍

Whether you're a doctor, a nurse, an ethics board member, or simply curious about what AI means for your daily life, the conversation is open. And the best part? It never goes the way you expect.
