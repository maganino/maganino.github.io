## The Question That Started It All

What if learning never felt like failure?

Most digital learning tools share a hidden assumption: test the learner, show them when they're wrong, reveal the correct answer, repeat. For neurodiverse learners, language students, or anyone who has ever abandoned an app out of frustration, this model simply doesn't work.

My co-founder Fedrik De Beul saw this firsthand after nearly two decades of coaching language learners. I saw it from the technology side, having spent years building AI systems that listen, learn, and adapt. We both asked the same question: can we make learning feel like play?

## A Different Approach

TipTong flips the script. Instead of testing and punishing, we guide learners through a creative process where success is always the destination. The brain does the work; we just provide the right nudge at the right time.

No red crosses. No "try again." Just a path that always leads somewhere meaningful.

## What Excites Me

What we're building goes beyond an app. Every interaction generates insights into *how* a person learns, not just *what* they got right or wrong. That data feeds an AI that adapts to you, not the other way around.

We're exploring territory where education meets cognitive science meets genuine human care. And the early conversations with researchers, publishers, and institutions tell us we're onto something.

## Why It Matters to Me

I've spent my career using technology to serve living beings. TipTong is the next chapter: making AI work for human intuition, not replace it.

Every learner deserves to feel clever, not defeated. If it's not enjoyable, it's not sustainable.

Stay curious. More is coming.
