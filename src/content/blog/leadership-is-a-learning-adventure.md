## The Job of a Leader

> *"The job of the leader is to bring out that magnificence in people and to create an environment where they feel safe and supported."*
> Kenneth Blanchard

I've been thinking about this quote a lot lately. Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of mentoring 12 master students and 7 PhD students, coaching group projects, and guiding teams through moments of doubt, breakthroughs, and everything in between.

And if there's one thing I've learned, it's this: **leadership is not about having the answers. It's about creating the space where answers can emerge.**

## Beyond the Technical

Early on, I made a conscious choice: mentoring would never be *just* about the research. Every person who walked into my office was more than a set of deliverables. They brought their intellect, their emotions, and their full context.

That shift in perspective changed everything. Instead of asking "Where are you with the paper?", I started asking "How are you doing?"

Sounds simple. It's not. It requires listening, real listening, and a willingness to sit with discomfort sometimes. But it builds something no status meeting ever could: **trust**.

## Situational Leadership: No One-Size-Fits-All

One framework that deeply influenced my approach is *situational leadership*: the idea that a good mentor moves fluidly between **directing**, **coaching**, **supporting**, and **delegating**, depending on where the mentee is in their development.

A first-year researcher paralysed by their first negative peer review? They need direction and reassurance. A senior student racing toward their defence? They need space and delegation.

The challenge is reading the room and adapting in real time. I got it wrong plenty of times before I got it right. And honestly? I'm still learning.

## Islands and Bridges

Here's something not everyone talks about: research can be lonely. PhDs often feel like they're working on separate islands, especially after a rejection or when comparison creeps in. I've been there myself.

So I started intentionally building **bridges between those islands**: shared tasks, collaborative experiments, moments where students had to cooperate across projects. Not to blur boundaries, but to build a sense of belonging.

Because autonomy without connection is isolation. And connection without focus is chaos. The sweet spot? Somewhere in between, and it shifts constantly.

## The Sabbatical That Changed Everything

Before any of this, though, something else shaped my leadership more than any training ever could.

After my bachelor's degree, I spent a year in a pilot village in Florence, living and working alongside young people from almost every culture and belief. It was part of a leadership programme by *Youth for a United World*. We cooked together, argued together, built things together.

That year gave me something no textbook could: **cultural adaptability**. The ability to sit in a room where nobody agrees on anything and still find a way forward. That skill has followed me into every lab, every meeting room, every mentoring session since.

## The Vulnerability of Responsibility

Here's a truth that doesn't get said enough: **positions of responsibility make us more vulnerable**, not less. More vulnerable to misusing our power. More vulnerable to burnout. More vulnerable to thinking we don't need help anymore.

Every mentor, especially in environments where the consequences of our decisions ripple through someone's career, needs to admit their own need for accompaniment. Leadership development shouldn't be optional. It should be embedded, supported, and given the time it deserves.

We wouldn't expect a researcher to publish without peer review. Why do we expect leaders to lead without reflection?

## The Ecosystem of Trust

If I had to distil everything I've learned into one sentence, it would be this:

> **Leadership is being what you want to see in your mentees.**

Show curiosity, they'll be curious. Show vulnerability, they'll open up. Show respect for their time, their ideas, their struggles, and they'll do the same for others.

Above all, build an **ecosystem of trust**. It's the foundation of every healthy mentor-mentee relationship, every productive team, every meaningful trajectory.

Leadership isn't a destination. It's a learning adventure, and I'm grateful to still be on it.
