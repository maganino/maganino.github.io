## Overview

VocaChick uses AI-driven vocal analysis to assess the welfare of day-old chicks in real time. By listening to the sounds chicks make during the critical first hours after hatching, the system detects distress, comfort levels, and health indicators, giving hatchery operators actionable insights without invasive handling.

The project bridges signal processing, machine learning, and animal welfare science, developed in collaboration with Petersime (world leader in hatchery equipment) and funded by VLAIO.

## My Role

- **Project Manager & Scientific Lead**: coordinated the full research pipeline from data acquisition to deployment
- Co-advised PhD and MSc students working on vocal feature extraction and classification
- Designed the acoustic monitoring architecture for hatchery environments
- Managed stakeholder communication between KU Leuven, Petersime, and VLAIO
- Led grant writing and reporting for VLAIO-funded tracks

## Challenges

- **Noise in hatcheries**: industrial fans, conveyor belts, and thousands of chicks create a hostile acoustic environment
- **Labelling**: annotating chick vocalisations for supervised learning required close collaboration with animal welfare experts
- **Real-time constraints**: the system needed to run on-site with low latency for actionable feedback

## Impact

- Developed a working prototype for real-time vocal welfare assessment
- Contributed to multiple peer-reviewed publications on chick vocalisation analysis
- Advanced the state-of-the-art in precision livestock farming through sound-based monitoring
- Strengthened the bridge between AI research and practical animal welfare applications
